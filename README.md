## <a name="code-objectives"></a> Code Objectives
#### Directions Given
* The user should be provided means to easily set the temperature
* The user should be provided a feedback of the current temperature
#### Added Functionality
* The user will have the ability to change the color of the lights
* The user will have the ability to change the units of the device
* The user will have the ability to change the brightness of the display
* The program will automatically store user inputs and will re-load them if power is lost
* The program will monitor the time spent with the thermoelectric cooling unit on and will cycle the unit to improve efficiency
* The program uses debounce delays on buttons to prevent jitter on input pin due to mechanical actuation 
* The program will change the light to white if the door is opened
